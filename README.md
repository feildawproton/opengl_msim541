# opengl_msim541
An old and simple school project (msin541) using opengl.

## 1.	Introduction 
This assignment is an extension of P2 introducing several new concepts.  In this assignment you will see texture binding and mapping to manually built billboards.  This assignment also demonstrates texture blending through the use of glActiveTexture() and glMultTexCoord2f().  There are classes and methods for reading in PPM files, writing them, and performing vertical flips of char pointers arraignment in the PPM format.  This project also shows screen capture generation and writing, and automatic screen capture of traffic violations.  This assignment also shows encapsulation of the simulation using a simulation engine base class.
